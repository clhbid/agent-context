description: Read and set work state on the CLHbid Delivery board — the delivery language, issues via gh, the Status field, the board query recipes, cycles, epics, labels, the commit convention and the decomposition rules. Use for any GitHub issue or project-board operation in a clhbid repo, and for what a cycle, epic or slipped issue means.

# Issue tracker: GitHub

Issues and specs for this repo live as GitHub issues. **Work state lives on the
[CLHbid Delivery](https://github.com/orgs/clhbid/projects/4) org project**, which spans every
clhbid repo. Use the `gh` CLI for all operations.

## Language

The words the skills plan and report in. Every rule below is written in these terms.

**Cycle**: a fortnight-ish planning period that work is committed to. Committing an issue to a
cycle is a promise to finish it in that cycle. _Avoid_: sprint, milestone.

**Slipped**: committed to a cycle and still open when it closed. Always a missed commitment, never
"progressing as expected". _Avoid_: in flight, carried over.

**Epic**: a top-level issue carrying the `Epic` issue type, too large for one cycle and delivered
through its children. An epic is never committed to a cycle; each child fits in one cycle and is
committed on its own. _Avoid_: initiative, program, tracker issue, parent (every epic is a parent;
few parents are epics).

**Committed unit**: the issue whose `Cycle` is set — a top-level issue, or a child of an epic. Its
descendants inherit the cycle and are never set directly. _Avoid_: planned issue, scheduled issue.

**Progress**: an epic's completed children over its total children. _Avoid_: percent complete,
velocity, burndown.

**Business work**: what the business plans and reads about — a top-level issue, or a child of an
epic. _Avoid_: ticket, story.

## Conventions

- **Create an issue**: `gh issue create --title "..." --body "..."`. Use a heredoc for multi-line
  bodies. This does not apply an issue form — follow
  [Creating an issue from the org form](#creating-an-issue-from-the-org-form).
- **Read, list, comment**: `gh issue view <number> --comments`, `gh issue list`,
  `gh issue comment <number> --body "..."`. `--jq` requires `--json`, so filtering a read means
  dropping `--comments` and naming the fields: `gh issue view <number> --json number,title,labels --jq ...`
- **Refer to an issue as `<org>/<repo>#<number>`**, in prose and in tables alike. GitHub renders
  that form as a link with a hovercard and shortens it to `#<number>` when it is same-repo, so the
  qualified form costs nothing to read. A **bare `#<number>` resolves against whichever repo hosts
  the text it sits in** — in an org discussion that is `clhbid/clhbid.com`, not the repo you meant —
  and links silently to the wrong issue. GitHub also shares one number space across issues and pull
  requests, so resolve an unqualified reference with `gh pr view <n>`, falling back to
  `gh issue view <n>`.
- **Set state**: a project field, not a label — see [Status](#status).
- **Close**: an issue closes as `completed`, `not planned` or `duplicate`. The reason is the
  record, so pick the one that matches and say why in a closing comment.

  ```bash
  # Completed — the work is done
  gh issue close <number> --reason completed --comment "Shipped in #<pr>."

  # Not planned — we are not delivering it, abandoned and deferred alike
  gh issue close <number> --reason "not planned" --comment "Deferred to <date>; <owner> holds it."

  # Duplicate — another issue carries the work
  gh issue close <number> --duplicate-of <other-number> --comment "Tracked under #<other-number>."
  ```

  - `completed` is the default when `--reason` is omitted.
  - `not planned` is two words — `not-planned` is rejected. It is the whole record for a deferral
    or an abandonment; nothing else is needed.
  - `--duplicate-of` sets the reason to `duplicate` and links the two issues, so the survivor's
    thread becomes the history. Take the number of the issue that stays open.
- **Fix a close reason**: `gh issue edit` cannot set one, and `gh issue close` no-ops on an
  already-closed issue. For `completed` and `not planned`, PATCH it:
  `gh api --method PATCH repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/{n} -f state=closed -f state_reason=not_planned`
  To record a duplicate after the fact, reopen and re-close:
  `gh issue reopen <number> && gh issue close <number> --duplicate-of <other-number>`.

## Status

`Status` on the CLHbid Delivery project is the **single source of truth** for what state an issue
is in.

| Status           | Meaning                                                                                        |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Backlog          | The inbox — everything not yet routed. New issues land here                                    |
| Waiting on input | We asked the reporter or the business something and cannot proceed until they answer           |
| Ready for Agent  | Fully specified, sliced to one pull request, and carrying an agent brief                       |
| Ready for Human  | Needs a person — judgement, external systems, manual verification, or a pull request to review |
| In progress      | Claimed and being worked                                                                       |
| Done             | Closed, for any reason (`completed`, `not planned` and `duplicate`)                            |

Everything else stays native and is never duplicated onto the board: **assignee** (who holds it),
**linked pull requests** (what is in review), **sub-issues** (decomposition), **issue
dependencies** (blocking), **closed** (finished).

**Triage empties `Backlog`.** Every issue arrives there and leaves by being routed to
`Ready for Agent`, `Ready for Human` or `Waiting on input`, or by being closed. Work considered and
deliberately deferred goes back to `Backlog` and is reconsidered next time — so `Backlog` never
means "already dealt with", and a full inbox is the normal state rather than a backlog of triage
debt.

**An empty `Waiting on input` is a healthy state**, not a query to debug: nothing is blocked on the
business.

**Prefer `Ready for Agent`**, which needs both halves of its row — fully specified _and_ already
sliced. Work that cannot be specified until someone decides something is `Waiting on input`: a
question to answer, not work to schedule. `Ready for Human` is for what no agent can finish. For
what counts as an agent brief, see [`afk-loop` § The agent brief](../afk-loop/SKILL.md#the-agent-brief).

**Claiming is an assignee write.** `gh issue edit <n> --add-assignee @me` is the atomic first
write that stops two agents taking the same issue; setting `Status` to `In progress` follows it.

**An issue that is not on the board has no state** and is invisible to every query below. Auto-add
workflows put newly-opened issues on the board; after creating one, give the workflow a moment and
then confirm it landed, adding anything that was missed.

**Adding one issue adds its whole tree.** Adding a parent pulls in every descendant, across
repository boundaries and including repos nobody had in scope. So planning being set on
[committed units](#business-and-delivery) does not make the board that shallow — most of it is
descendants, and they arrive with `Cycle` unset. Any group-by-`Cycle` view therefore carries a
large **No Cycle** bucket: descendants whose committed ancestor is planned, and epics, which never
carry one.

### Setting Status

`gh project item-edit` needs three IDs. Look them up once per session:

```bash
# project id, Status field id, and the option id for each status
gh api graphql -f query='
  query { organization(login: "clhbid") { projectV2(number: 4) {
    id field(name: "Status") { ... on ProjectV2SingleSelectField { id options { id name } } } } } }'

# the item id for an issue (an issue may sit on several projects — take project 4)
gh api graphql -f query='
  query($owner: String!, $repo: String!, $num: Int!) {
    repository(owner: $owner, name: $repo) { issue(number: $num) {
      projectItems(first: 10) { nodes { id project { number } } } } } }' \
  -f owner="$(gh repo view --json owner --jq .owner.login)" \
  -f repo="$(gh repo view --json name --jq .name)" \
  -F num=<number> \
  --jq '.data.repository.issue.projectItems.nodes[] | select(.project.number == 4) | .id'
```

**Take the repo from the checkout, never a literal.** The board spans every clhbid repo and issue
numbers are per-repo, so a pinned `repo=` resolves the wrong issue somewhere else — usually a
`NOT_FOUND`, but a number that exists in both repos returns a real item id for the wrong issue, and
`item-edit` accepts it.

Then:

```bash
gh project item-edit --project-id <project-id> --id <item-id> \
  --field-id <status-field-id> --single-select-option-id <option-id>
```

Read the value back afterwards — a wrong option id is accepted silently.

## Triage roles

The skills speak in terms of five canonical triage roles. Here a role is a **`Status` value**, not
a label — [Status](#status) has what each one means.

| Role in mattpocock/skills | Status here                         |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `needs-triage`            | Backlog                             |
| `needs-info`              | Waiting on input                    |
| `ready-for-agent`         | Ready for Agent                     |
| `ready-for-human`         | Ready for Human                     |
| `wontfix`                 | close with `--reason "not planned"` |

When a skill says "apply the AFK-ready triage label", set `Status` to the value in this table.
`In progress` and `Done` have no counterpart in that vocabulary.

## Business and delivery

**Decomposition is a delivery concern.** Work is broken into sub-issues so it can be tracked,
sliced and reviewed one pull request at a time — see
[Decomposing work before Ready for Agent](#decomposing-work-before-ready-for-agent). The business
does not track work at that grain: a **top-level issue is the unit of business work**, and its
children are how that work gets done. The one exception is an [epic](#epics), whose children are
each business work in their own right because each is committed to a cycle on its own.

The board carries both audiences as views — **📋 Delivery board** is everything but epics,
**💼 Business** is `no:parent-issue -type:Epic`, and **🗺️ Epics** is the epics with their progress.
The same split governs anything read outside the board:

- **Reporting to the business** — cycle notes, and anything else the business reads — is business
  work only, counts included: top-level issues and the children of epics, with epics themselves
  reported in their own section rather than in any cycle table. Add the `business` filter below to
  any recipe to get its business view, as the **Planning view** recipe does. A board view cannot
  express it — project filters have no OR across qualifiers — which is why **💼 Business** shows
  epic children only through the cycle views.
- **Dispatching and doing the work** reads the leaves, because that is where a branch and a pull
  request attach. The **Agent frontier** recipe is the example: it excludes anything with children.

## Querying the board

Issue search cannot read project fields: `status:"In progress"` is not a qualifier and matches
nothing. Every state query therefore runs against the board with
[`board.graphql`](board.graphql) — one query, filtered per use with `--jq`.

**Find `board.graphql` first.** It sits beside this file, but where that is depends on how the
skill was installed. Resolve it once per session and reuse it:

```bash
for p in ~/.claude/skills/issue-tracker/board.graphql \
         ~/.agents/skills/issue-tracker/board.graphql \
         .claude/skills/issue-tracker/board.graphql; do
  [ -f "$p" ] && BOARD_QUERY="$p" && break
done
```

If none of them exists, say so rather than guessing — every recipe below needs it.

```bash
# Agent frontier — ready, leaf, unblocked, unclaimed
gh api graphql --paginate -F query=@"$BOARD_QUERY" --jq '
  .data.organization.projectV2.items.nodes[]
  | select(.content.state == "OPEN" and .status.name == "Ready for Agent"
           and .content.assignees.totalCount == 0
           and .content.subIssues.totalCount == 0
           and .content.issueDependenciesSummary.blockedBy == 0)
  | "\(.content.repository.name)#\(.content.number)  \(.content.title)"'

# Needs triage — the inbox
... | select(.content.state == "OPEN" and .status.name == "Backlog")

# Needs business input
... | select(.content.state == "OPEN" and .status.name == "Waiting on input")

# In flight
... | select(.content.state == "OPEN" and .content.assignees.totalCount > 0)

# Business filter — top-level issues and epic children, never an epic itself. Goes at the head of
# the jq program, before `.data`, in any recipe that wants its business view
def business: .content.issueType.name != "Epic"
              and (.content.parent == null or .content.parent.issueType.name == "Epic");

# Planning view — open business work
... | select(.content.state == "OPEN" and business)

# Epics — every open epic with its progress
... | select(.content.state == "OPEN" and .content.issueType.name == "Epic")
    | "\(.content.repository.name)#\(.content.number)  \(.content.subIssuesSummary.completed) of \(.content.subIssuesSummary.total)  \(.content.title)"

# Epics ready to close — open, with every child closed. A person closes them
... | select(.content.state == "OPEN" and .content.issueType.name == "Epic"
             and .content.subIssuesSummary.total > 0
             and .content.subIssuesSummary.completed == .content.subIssuesSummary.total)

# Epic children closed in a cycle — the per-cycle progress of every epic
... | select(.content.parent.issueType.name == "Epic" and .content.state == "CLOSED"
             and .content.closedAt >= env.CYCLE_START and .content.closedAt < env.CYCLE_END)

# Status/state mismatch — the Item closed workflow missing one. Healthy result is empty
... | select((.content.state == "CLOSED" and .status.name != "Done")
          or (.content.state == "OPEN"   and .status.name == "Done"))

# Worked off-cycle — work that never got credited to the cycle it happened in
... | select((.content.state == "CLOSED"
              and .content.closedAt >= env.CYCLE_START and .content.closedAt < env.CYCLE_END
              and (.cycle.title // "") != env.CYCLE_TITLE)
          or (.content.state == "OPEN" and .status.name == "In progress" and .cycle == null
              and .content.updatedAt >= env.CYCLE_START))

# ...of which dormant — swap that last clause for uncycled In progress work nobody touched
              and .content.updatedAt < env.CYCLE_START))

# Stale closed items — closed but never archived. Healthy result is empty
... | select(.content.state == "CLOSED"
             and (.content.closedAt | fromdateiso8601) < (now - 4838400))

# Stale issues — actionable work untouched for eight weeks
... | select(.content.state == "OPEN"
             and (.status.name | IN("Backlog", "Ready for Agent", "Ready for Human"))
             and (.content.updatedAt | fromdateiso8601) < (now - 4838400))

# ...of which newly stale — add this clause to keep the ones not yet stale when the cycle began
             and (.content.updatedAt | fromdateiso8601)
                 >= ((env.CYCLE_START | strptime("%Y-%m-%d") | mktime) - 4838400)
```

`...` stands in for the full command above. `--paginate` applies `--jq` per page, so filtering and
listing work as written; counting needs a pipe (`| wc -l`).

**Archived items are invisible here.** `ProjectV2.items` defaults to
`archivedStates: [NOT_ARCHIVED]`, so every recipe reads the live board only. That is what makes the
stale-closed recipe re-runnable — it cannot see what it just archived — and it is why the `Cycle`
snapshot in [Cycles](#cycles) passes `archivedStates: [ARCHIVED, NOT_ARCHIVED]` explicitly.

**Eight weeks is 4838400 seconds**, and it is the definition of _stale_ — an item is stale on the
board, not in someone's judgement. The cycle recipes read `CYCLE_TITLE`, `CYCLE_START` and
`CYCLE_END` from the environment; set them from the iteration's `title`, `startDate` and
`startDate + duration`. `CYCLE_END` is **exclusive** — an iteration ends the day before the meeting
that closes it, so a cycle titled `14 Aug → 28 Aug` has `CYCLE_START=2026-08-14` and
`CYCLE_END=2026-08-28`.

**Newly stale is derived, never stored.** It compares one `updatedAt` against two thresholds: stale
against today, and not-yet-stale against `CYCLE_START`. There is no baseline to snapshot at the end
of a cycle. Anchoring it to `CYCLE_END` instead would ask which items went stale between today and
today, and return nothing.

**These recipes are canonical**, and no API returns a view's contents — so a view can never be
queried directly, only mirrored:

| #   | View              | Filter                                             | Purpose                                   |
| --- | ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| 1   | 📋 Delivery board | `-type:Epic`                                       | everything but epics, grouped by `Status` |
| 2   | 🎯 This cycle     | `cycle:@current`                                   | the running cycle                         |
| 3   | ⏭️ Next cycle     | `cycle:@next`                                      | what is planned next                      |
| 4   | 💼 Business       | `no:parent-issue -type:Epic`                       | top-level work, delivered and outstanding |
| 5   | 🤖 Frontier       | `status:"Ready for Agent" no:assignee -is:blocked` | mirrors the frontier recipe               |
| 6   | ⏳ Waiting        | `status:"Waiting on input"`                        | mirrors the needs-business-input recipe   |
| 8   | 📥 Triage         | `status:Backlog no:parent-issue`                   | the inbox, top-level only                 |
| 9   | 🗺️ Epics          | `type:Epic`                                        | mirrors the epics recipe                  |

View **numbers** are stable and never reused after a delete, which is why 7 is missing. Only the
filter is worth asserting against this table: a view's name, columns and tab position belong to
whoever uses it, so a change there is intent rather than drift. The one column worth naming is
**Sub-issues progress** on 🗺️ Epics — a built-in field, and the progress bar the view exists for.

**A filter is writable.** `updateProjectV2View` takes `name`, `layout`, `filter` and
`configuration`, so a drifted filter can be **repaired**, not only reported. Grouping and sorting
are **readable** — `ProjectV2View` exposes `groupByFields`, `verticalGroupByFields` and
`sortByFields` — but not writable: `ProjectV2ViewConfigurationInput` takes only `visibleFieldIds`.

Both board views group by `Cycle` as swimlanes with `Status` as the columns, and **an iteration with
no items renders no swimlane** — so a completed cycle leaves the board once its items are archived,
and no filter is needed to hide one.

## Cycles

A cycle is an iteration of the `Cycle` field. An iteration **ends the day before the meeting that
closes it**.

Read them from the field's `configuration`. `completedIterations` holds the closed ones; the
running cycle is the entry in `iterations` whose `startDate` is on or before today and whose
`startDate + duration` is after it, and the future cycles are the ones starting after it. Select by
date rather than by index — nothing guarantees the array's order.

`Cycle` is set on the **committed unit** — a top-level issue, or a child of an [epic](#epics) —
and its descendants inherit it, so a sub-issue with no `Cycle` is planned, not missed. An epic's
own `Cycle` is never set.

**Three iterations are live at all times** — the running cycle and two future ones — so planning
always has somewhere to put work deferred two meetings out.

**The title carries the theme**, and until one is agreed it is the date range as a placeholder
(`Sep 29 - Oct 12`). Dates live in the iteration's own `startDate` and `duration`. **Titles must be
unique**: recovering from a configuration write resolves iterations by title, and two cycles sharing
one makes that ambiguous.

### Writing the configuration clears the whole board

`updateProjectV2Field` is the only mutation that touches `iterationConfiguration`, and **every write
is a full replacement that regenerates every iteration id and clears every item's `Cycle`**. Even an
identical configuration written back does it, so appending an iteration costs exactly what renaming
one does. The input also has **no `completedIterations`**, so any completed cycle not passed back
inside `iterations` is deleted outright.

**Make one configuration write per cycle**, folding every pending change into it — the new
iteration, the agreed end date, any theme titles — and wrap it:

1. **Snapshot** every item's `Cycle`, keyed by `<org>/<repo>#<number>`. Archived items carry values
   too, so this is its own query passing `archivedStates: [ARCHIVED, NOT_ARCHIVED]` —
   [`board.graphql`](board.graphql) is live-only and would silently skip them.
2. **Write once**, passing **all** iterations, completed ones past-dated so GitHub re-sorts them
   back into `completedIterations`. The configuration's own `startDate` cannot be read back — only
   `startDay` is exposed — so pass the earliest iteration's `startDate`.
3. **Restore** every snapshot value, resolving iterations **by title**, because every id changed.
4. **Read back** `completedIterations` and the restored count. An empty `completedIterations` is the
   failure signature; a count short of the snapshot means items were missed.


## Epics

An epic is work too large for one cycle — see [Language](#language). The hierarchy is
**epic → issue → sub-issues**, the first and last optional, and the epic layer is one deep: an
epic sits under nothing, and its children are the committed units. Work that turns out to span
cycles becomes an epic by being split into children that each fit one.

- **The `Epic` issue type is the marker**, and the only issue type the skills key off. Set it with
  `gh api --method PATCH repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/{n} -f type=Epic`; `gh issue create` cannot,
  so create the issue and PATCH it. Find them with `gh issue list --search type:Epic`, or the
  **Epics** recipe. If the org has no `Epic` type, creating one is `createIssueType` on the org
  node, and it needs the `admin:org` scope that the default `gh` login lacks.
- **Status walks the ordinary ladder**, and so does each child, triaged like anything else.
  `Backlog` while the epic still needs decomposing, `Ready for Human` once its children exist,
  `In progress` from the first child committed to a cycle, `Done` when a person closes it.
- **`Cycle` is never set on the epic.** Each child is a committed unit and carries its own — so a
  child left open at cycle close slipped, and the epic is neither done nor slipped, only
  progressing.
- **Decompose before the first child is committed.** Progress counts direct children only, so it
  reads truthfully only when every child is a one-cycle piece. A child that will not fit a cycle
  is split into two children of the epic, keeping the layer one deep.
- **Closing is a judgement**, so a person does it. The **Epics ready to close** recipe finds
  candidates.

## Deferring work

Deferring is a decision to record. Its form follows when the work comes back:

- **A future cycle** — set `Cycle` to one of the two ahead. The issue stays open and the board
  carries it.
- **A later date** — comment with the decision, the owner, and when it returns, then close with
  `--reason "not planned"`. The owner sets the calendar reminder; nothing in GitHub will raise it
  for them.
- **Unknown** — leave it in [`Backlog`](#status) for triage to reconsider.

**Reopen rather than refile** when it comes back, so the thread stays the history.

## Labels

Labels never carry state. Two matter:

- **`bug`** — something is broken.
- **`enhancement`** — everything else: new features, and the tooling, config and refactor work we
  used to call chores.

Issue templates apply exactly one of them, and `/wayfinder` adds its own — see
[Wayfinding operations](#wayfinding-operations).

Any other label is decoration — read it if you like, but nothing keys off it.

## Creating an issue from the org form

Issue forms in `clhbid/.github/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` are the source of truth for what an issue
body contains.

Before `gh issue create`, fetch the form you need:

```bash
gh api repos/clhbid/.github/contents/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/<bug|enhancement>.yml \
  --jq .content | base64 -d
```

Use each field's `label` as a `### ` heading in the issue body, in the same order as the form. Fill
every required field. Omit optional fields when they do not apply. This rule applies to any
agent-authored body, including later edits.

Anything beyond the form's fields — acceptance criteria, interface notes, verification steps, or
scope boundaries outside the form itself — belongs in the issue's agent-brief comment (or a
triage-notes comment), not as extra body headings. See [`afk-loop` § The agent brief](../afk-loop/SKILL.md#the-agent-brief).

Creating this way still means one category label (`bug` or `enhancement`), no state label, and then
confirming the issue landed on `Backlog` — see [Status](#status).

## Templates apply a category, never a state

Issue forms come from the org defaults in `clhbid/.github` under `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`. **A
person filing an issue should use one** — they collect fields a triager otherwise has to ask for.

A form applies exactly one **category** label (`bug` or `enhancement`) and **no state**. Category
says what kind of thing an issue is; `Status` says where it has got to — nothing about the category
implies a state.
When an agent creates an issue without the browser form, use
[Creating an issue from the org form](#creating-an-issue-from-the-org-form).

## Commit convention

Commit subjects carry the issue number as a bare prefix — `2217: <subject>`. A trailing `(#NNNN)`
is the **pull request**, added by squash-merge, and is never the issue. When resolving the spec for
a diff, read the leading `NNNN:` and ignore the trailing `(#NNNN)`.

## Decomposing work before Ready for Agent

Keep `1 issue = 1 branch = 1 PR`. If work is too large, split the **issue**, not the pull request.
Size is a precondition of `Ready for Agent`. Work too large for a **cycle** is an [epic](#epics),
split one level higher.

**Smaller is better.** ~1000 changed lines is the ceiling — excluding lockfiles, snapshots and
generated files — but it is a limit, not a target: a changeset that splits cleanly should be split
well below it, because a reviewer reads a small diff and skims a large one. If a plan crosses the
ceiling, simplify first, dropping surplus documentation before anything else, then split. There is
no CI gate for this.

- A valid slice is **independently mergeable and green**. Behaviour-neutral slices (rename,
  extraction, refactor) count when they stand alone.
- **Stack the pull requests when slices depend on each other.** A pull request can target a branch
  other than `main`, and GitHub retargets it automatically when its base merges — so a dependent
  slice can be opened and reviewed straight away instead of waiting for its parent to land.
- **If an agent finds mid-flight that work is too large**, it simplifies, creates sub-issues, links
  them as children, sets the leaves to `Ready for Agent`, opens a pull request for the work it has
  finished — stacked on the previous slice where they depend on each other — and comments on the
  original issue explaining the cut.

## Pull requests as a triage surface

**PRs as a request surface: no.** _(Set to `yes` if this repo treats external PRs as feature requests; `/triage` reads this flag.)_ While it is `no`, external PRs are not triaged and no `gh pr` state handling applies.

## When a skill says…

- **"publish to the issue tracker"** — create a GitHub issue via
  [Creating an issue from the org form](#creating-an-issue-from-the-org-form).
- **"fetch the relevant ticket"** — `gh issue view <number> --comments`.

## Wayfinding operations

Used by `/wayfinder`. The **map** is a single issue with **child** issues as tickets.

- **Map**: a single issue labelled `wayfinder:map`, holding the Notes / Decisions-so-far / Fog body. `gh issue create --label wayfinder:map`.
- **Child ticket**: an issue linked to the map as a GitHub sub-issue (`gh api` on the sub-issues endpoint). Labels: `wayfinder:<type>` (`research`/`prototype`/`grilling`/`task`). Once claimed, the ticket is assigned to the driving dev.
- **Blocking**: GitHub's **native issue dependencies**. Add an edge with `gh api --method POST repos/<owner>/<repo>/issues/<child>/dependencies/blocked_by -F issue_id=<blocker-db-id>`, where `<blocker-db-id>` is the blocker's numeric **database id** (`gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/issues/<n> --jq .id`, _not_ the `#number` or `node_id`). GitHub reports `issue_dependencies_summary.blocked_by` (open blockers only — the live gate). A ticket is unblocked when every blocker is closed.
- **Frontier query**: list the map's open children, drop any with an open blocker or an assignee; first in map order wins.
- **Claim**: `gh issue edit <n> --add-assignee @me` — the session's first write.
- **Resolve**: `gh issue comment <n> --body "<answer>"`, then `gh issue close <n>`, then append a context pointer (gist + link) to the map's Decisions-so-far.

## Traps

**A wrong filter looks correct.** GitHub ignores an unknown qualifier rather than erroring. It can
fail in either direction — a typo may return everything, while `status:"In progress"` in issue
search returns nothing — so a result count proves nothing on its own. Check a new filter against a
query whose answer you already know.

**REST lies about parentage.** `gh issue view --json parent` errors outright, and
`gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/{n} --jq .parent.number` returns `null` for a child exactly as
for a top-level issue. GraphQL's `Issue.parent` answers truthfully, which is what
[`board.graphql`](board.graphql) selects. Checking issue by issue costs a request each and gets
skipped under pressure, so **put `no:parent-issue` (or `.content.parent == null`) in the query
itself**.

**Adding an item unarchives it.** `addProjectV2ItemById` on an already-archived item silently
returns it to the live board. Archived items are invisible to a live-only read, so a **reopened**
issue looks absent, gets re-added, and comes back out of the archive as a side effect.

**A read-back can be stale.** The project API is eventually consistent. Verify every write by
read-back, but treat a mismatch straight after a write as unconfirmed rather than failed — re-check
after a delay, and never re-issue the write on the strength of one disagreeing read.
`issueDependenciesSummary.blockedBy` lags the same way — it read `0` immediately after a blocker was
linked and `1` shortly after — so the **Agent frontier** recipe run straight after a write can hand
out an issue that is already blocked.
