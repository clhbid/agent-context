# Cycle Review

The cycle review is a **round trip through a GitHub Discussion**. Branch A publishes the meeting
notes as a Discussion, the meeting works through them, the project manager posts their decisions as
a comment, and branch B turns those decisions into tracker writes.

**The Discussion is the record.** It is what anyone reads later to see what was planned versus
delivered, and it is the baseline the next cycle's notes are diffed against. Notes go in the
[**Meetings** category](https://github.com/orgs/clhbid/discussions/categories/meetings).

**Every org-wide discussion is hosted by the `clhbid/clhbid.com` repository**, whatever
`github.com/orgs/clhbid/discussions` implies — that is the repo the API reads and writes them
through, and it is why a bare `#<number>` anywhere in the notes resolves against `clhbid.com`. `gh`
has no discussion command, so use `gh api graphql`: `createDiscussion`, `updateDiscussion`, and
`repository { discussion(number:) }` to read one back.

**The notes are not edited during the meeting.** The project manager posts a comment using the same
headers, and branch B integrates it afterwards. That keeps the published body a clean record and
the decisions attributable.

A cycle is an iteration of the `Cycle` field; work state is the `Status` field. Both live on the
CLHbid Delivery project. **Read the field mechanics, the `Status` values, the reference convention
and every board query from the `issue-tracker` skill** — this skill names the recipes it needs and
never restates them, so the two cannot drift.

**Everything branch A reports is the business view.** Every section of the notes, every number
quoted beside one, and anything said in conversation about them filters to `no:parent-issue` — see
**Business and delivery** in `issue-tracker`. The one thing that must not be lost to the filter is
a **question**: when the issue blocking on business input is a sub-issue, list its parent as the
item and name the child, so branch B knows which issue the answer lands on.

**The notes are a business document.** No agent commentary — tooling state, recipe caveats and
process notes go to the project manager in conversation or into your own TODO list.

## Cycle roles

Roles are resolved from the `Cycle` field's `configuration` by date, never by array order or by
reading a title:

| Role    | Where it comes from                                                          |
| ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| closing | the most recent entry in `completedIterations` — the cycle the meeting closes |
| current | the entry in `iterations` whose `startDate + duration` brackets today         |
| future  | the two entries in `iterations` starting after current                        |

An iteration **ends the day before the meeting that closes it**. **If the roles cannot be resolved,
stop and say so** — never invent an assignment.

Every membership change is `gh project item-edit` against the `Cycle` field, on **top-level issues
only** — children inherit their parent's cycle. Every state change is a `Status` value from the
`issue-tracker` role map. The milestones API plays no part in this skill.

**Confirm before every mutating step.** Show the proposed cycle and status values, closures, issue
body edits, notes body and iteration-configuration diff, get an explicit go-ahead, then read the
write back. A read-back that disagrees straight after a write is unconfirmed, not failed — re-check
after a moment rather than re-issuing it.

## Invocation

- **A. Prepare** — `/cycle-review prepare for the 2026-08-28 meeting, next one is 2026-09-11`
- **B. Process notes** — `/cycle-review process the notes from discussion 2323`
- **C. Adjust** — `/cycle-review move clhbid/clhbid.com#2325 into the current cycle; defer
  clhbid/CLHbid-LiveAuction#922 to the next one`

## Branch A — Prepare the notes

Branch A publishes the notes discussion and writes to the tracker only in the bookkeeping steps
below. **They run first**, before a line of the draft is written, because they change what the
tables say. _Automatic_ means no meeting decides them — they still show their list and take a
go-ahead, like every other mutation.

1. **Open the next cycle.** Three iterations must be live: current plus two future. If only two
   are, add one. **This is a destructive configuration write** — follow the procedure in
   `issue-tracker`, and fold every other pending change into the same write, because a second one
   costs a second restore of the whole board.
2. **Housekeeping.** Run the `issue-tracker` **stale closed items** recipe. **It should be empty** —
   `board:sync` archives everything closed before the last completed cycle began, nightly. A
   non-empty result is therefore diagnostic rather than routine debris: check when the nightly job
   last ran before treating it as broken, and raise a real failure with the project manager in
   conversation. Archive by hand with `archiveProjectV2Item` only if the meeting cannot wait.
   **Either way this stays out of the notes.**
3. **Worked-off-cycle backfill.** Run the `issue-tracker` **worked off-cycle** recipe against the
   closing cycle's window and keep the top-level results. A sub-issue needs no write and no row —
   it inherits its parent's cycle. This is bookkeeping, not triage: no meeting decision, no
   `Decision` line.
   - **Closed** work is credited to the cycle it was completed in — set `Cycle` — and appears as an
     extra `➕ Added mid-cycle, done` row in **Last Cycle**.
   - **`In progress`** work touched during the closing cycle was picked up without ever being
     committed to it. Credit it to the cycle now opening — unfinished work belongs to the cycle
     that will finish it — and record it in **both** places: an `➕ Added mid-cycle, not done` row
     in **Last Cycle** whose reason says it carries forward, and an entry in **Committed This
     Cycle**. A row in one place only reads as work that appeared from nowhere.
   - **Dormant** work — the **dormant** variant of the same recipe, untouched since before the
     closing cycle began — gets **no write**. It has either stalled, which means the cycle was
     over-committed, or it is blocked and nobody said so. List it as its own decision with its
     status flagged **suspect**. Never auto-credit it, and never reset it to `Backlog`.
4. **Read the board.** Project items, the `Cycle` configuration, and the previous cycle's notes
   discussion.
5. **Draft Last Cycle.** Restate the closing cycle's goal, then table every issue committed to it.
   **`Result` is filled in** — closed is `✅ Done`, open is `❌ Slipped`. **`Reason` is blank**
   unless the row slipped or was added mid-cycle, and it is filled **only from direct evidence**: a
   closing pull request, a comment, sub-issue state. Leave it blank rather than inferring one. Diff
   the membership against the previous cycle's notes so slippage and mid-cycle additions are
   visible rather than silently absorbed.
6. **Draft Next Cycle Review** — date, time and location together, from the invocation or empty. It
   comes **before** Current Cycle because it sets when the cycle ends, and therefore how much fits
   in it.
7. **Draft Current Cycle**, sections in this order, because each one feeds the next: **New Issue
   Triage** (every issue opened since the closing cycle started, `Decision` blank), **Stale
   Issues** (next step), **Waiting on Input** (every `Status = Waiting on input` issue, listed
   **one at a time** with its own `Decision`, never summarised as a count), **Significant Dates** (a
   blank prompt), then **Committed This Cycle**, carrying anything the backfill already credited.

   Report the count of items already `In progress` alongside Committed This Cycle. **We finish what
   we start**: started work takes precedence, and new work should not be accepted into the cycle
   while it is outstanding.

   Each **Waiting on Input** row states the question and its decision. **The question must already
   exist as a comment on the issue** — a plain comment stating it is enough; the _Triage Notes_
   heading is a convention, not the test. If no comment asks it, that is an **error**: the question
   has never been put to anyone, so say so rather than reconstructing one from the title.
8. **Draft Stale Issues.** Run the `issue-tracker` **stale issues** recipe and report two numbers:
   the total stale, and how many went **newly stale** during the cycle just closing — that second
   number is derived from the same `updatedAt`, anchored to the closing cycle's `startDate`, not
   from a baseline anyone stored. Then do the reading:
   - **Close candidates** — a handful, judged on _old_, _underspecified_ or _duplicate_. This means
     reading each candidate's body and cross-checking the board for duplicates. Sorting by age is
     not the job.
   - **Needs a cycle, not a close** — stale work that plainly still needs doing, flagged for
     pulling into this cycle's triage instead.
   - **Newly stale, worth a look** — anything that went stale this cycle and looks important on its
     own evidence: comment volume, a prior assignee, other issues referencing it. A judgement call,
     not a threshold.
9. **Draft Future Work** — one sub-section per future cycle, headed by the iteration name, each
   with its own table. Separate tables make the load committed to each cycle visible at a glance;
   one wide table with a cycle column does not.
10. **Draft the closing sections.** **Out of Office** is a blank prompt for the team. **Next
    Actions** is present but empty, showing the owner-first shape.
11. **Reconcile against the live board.** Every cycle section must agree with what the board
    actually says. `clhbid/clhbid.com#2325` was committed to a cycle and missing from Committed
    This Cycle because the two were written as separate steps with nothing comparing them.
12. **Publish.** Create the Discussion, or update it if this cycle's notes already exist. **Branch A
    is re-runnable**: run it again whenever the board changes and it revises the same discussion.

**Every section is worked one decision at a time.** That is why each triage line, each
`Waiting on input` question and each stale candidate carries its own `Decision` rather than a
shared verdict at the end of a table — a section with one decision on it gets skimmed, and the
items underneath get silently agreed to.

See [The notes](#the-notes) for the shape, with every `Decision`, `Reason` and **Next Actions** line
blank in the draft and filled in on the way back.

## Branch B — Process the returned notes

Read the published body and the project manager's comment from the API by discussion number.

**Accept both reference forms.** The qualified `clhbid/<repo>#<number>` resolves as written. A bare
`#<number>` resolves against `clhbid/clhbid.com`, the repo hosting the discussion — **say which
issue you resolved it to** before acting on it, because that default is wrong as often as it is
right.

1. **Last Cycle** — the discussion is the record and the backfill already set every `Cycle` in
   branch A. Nothing to write.
2. **Sweep.** **No open item may still carry the closing cycle** (`cycle:@previous is:open` on the
   board). Reassign every straggler with `gh project item-edit` — usually to current, or clear the
   field if the work was dropped. This step is dull and sits in front of the interesting work,
   which is exactly the shape that invites skipping it; an orphan left behind is invisible to every
   cycle-scoped view from then on.
3. **New Issue Triage** — apply each line: set `Cycle` and `Status` with `gh project item-edit`, or
   close the issue with `--reason "not planned"`.
4. **Stale Issues** — apply each line: close candidates are closed `--reason "not planned"`; work
   pulled into a cycle gets its `Cycle` set like anything else triaged at this meeting; items
   merely flagged as worth watching get **no write at all** — they are informational, and they
   resurface in next cycle's stale report on their own.
5. **Waiting on Input** — for each answered question, record it on the issue in two places: reply
   to the comment that asked it, prefixed `> *Recorded from the <date> planning meeting.*`, and
   **fold the answer into the issue body** so someone picking the work up cold has the whole spec.
   The comment is the audit trail; the body is the spec. Never delete what was there. An item the
   meeting could not resolve is **left untouched**, `Waiting on input` and all — it reappears in
   next cycle's notes by itself.

   Then route it off `Waiting on input`, and only when **every** question on the issue is answered:
   `Ready for Agent` **only if the updated body now reads as a complete brief an agent could work
   from cold** — this is the gate that keeps the AFK queue trustworthy; `Ready for Human` if it
   needs judgement, external access, a design decision or manual testing; `Backlog` if it is
   answered but still underspecified, said out loud rather than guessed at. An answer that raises a
   **new** question has not unblocked anything: post the new question as a comment in the same
   shape and leave the issue on `Waiting on input`.
6. **Significant Dates** and **Out of Office** — informational. They are context for what the team
   could commit to; they produce no tracker write.
7. **Committed This Cycle** and each **Future Work** section — set `Cycle` on each top-level issue,
   skipping anything the branch A backfill already credited.
8. **Next Actions** — decide by **what the line describes, not who owns it**. The project manager's
   own lines cover both tracker work they delegate to you and follow-ups they handle themselves, so
   the owner tells you nothing. Execute the tracker actions — cycle and status changes, closures,
   the new-issue draft. Leave person-to-person follow-ups alone.
9. **Apply any agreed cycle date change** to the `Cycle` field's configuration. **The write is
   destructive** — follow the procedure in `issue-tracker`. Branch A has usually already made this
   cycle's one configuration write, so an agreed date should have gone in with it; a separate write
   here costs a second restore of the whole board.
10. **Draft an issue** for work in the notes that matches nothing on the board — category label
    only, no state, body drawn from the notes. It is new input, so it lands in `Backlog` like
    anything filed from a template.
11. **Update the discussion** with the decisions integrated, then **re-check for issues closed
    since the notes were published** — meeting-morning merges land after the cut and would
    otherwise be credited to the wrong cycle.

## Branch C — Adjust

Move membership with `gh project item-edit` on `Cycle`, or clear it when work is dropped, then note
the change in the next notes discussion.

## The notes

Below is a **completed** set of notes — the input branch B receives, every `Decision`, `Reason` and
**Next Actions** line filled in. It is also the target branch A drafts toward: the same headings,
the same order, the same prompts, with those fields blank instead. Reproduce this shape.

Notice the **Next Actions** register: outcomes in business language, owner first. Field names and
`gh` syntax never appear there — the team reads this, and branch B recognises a tracker action by
what it describes.

_Illustrative example. The organisation, repositories, issue numbers and titles are invented, chosen
to cover the range of states the skill has to handle. Nothing here is real work._

# Cycle Review — 18 Mar 2026 meeting

## Last Cycle: Checkout reliability & vendor migration (4 Mar → 17 Mar 2026)

**Goal:** Stop checkout failing under load, and finish moving off the old payments vendor.

| Issue | Title | Result | Reason |
| ----- | ----- | ------ | ------ |
| acme/site#412 | Retry failed payment captures instead of dropping them | ✅ Done | — |
| acme/site#418 | Checkout times out when the vendor is slow to respond | ✅ Done | — |
| acme/api#207 | Remove the legacy payments client | ✅ Done | — |
| acme/infra#88 | Alert on checkout error rate rather than raw 5xx count | ✅ Done | — |
| acme/site#421 | Migrate stored payment methods to the new vendor | ❌ Slipped → current cycle | 3 of 8 children done. The export ran, but the vendor's import API rate-limits at a rate that makes a single-pass migration impossible; needs a batched approach. |
| acme/api#215 | Retire the vendor webhook shim | ❌ Slipped → current cycle | Blocked on acme/site#421 — the shim cannot go until stored methods have moved. |
| acme/site#430 | Fix the currency rounding error on partial refunds | ➕ Added mid-cycle, done | Reported by finance mid-cycle and treated as urgent; nothing was displaced to fit it. |
| acme/infra#91 | Rotate the credentials the old vendor had access to | ➕ Added mid-cycle, done | Closed during the cycle without ever being committed to it. |
| acme/api#219 | Split the checkout handler so failures are isolated | ➕ Added mid-cycle, not done | Picked up mid-cycle without being committed; carries into the current cycle, where it is listed under Committed This Cycle. |

**Decision:** Both slipped items carry into the current cycle as-is. The batching approach for
acme/site#421 is agreed in principle — no rework of what has already migrated.

## Next Cycle Review

_Agreed first, because it sets when the current cycle ends and therefore how much fits in it._

**Date:** 1 Apr 2026
**Time:** 10:00 AM MT
**Location:** Video call — link in the calendar invite

## Current Cycle: Search relevance (18 Mar → 31 Mar 2026)

### New Issue Triage

_Every issue opened since the last cycle, and where it landed._

| Issue | Title | Status | Decision |
| ----- | ----- | ------ | -------- |
| acme/site#437 | Search returns nothing for hyphenated terms | `Backlog` | ➡️ This cycle — reported by three customers this week |
| acme/site#441 | Add a "recently viewed" row to the listings page | `Backlog` | ⏸ Reporting refresh — no urgency, and it fits that theme better |
| acme/api#224 | Document the search ranking fields | `Ready for Agent` | ➡️ This cycle — small, and unblocks acme/site#437 |
| acme/infra#96 | Evaluate a managed search service | `Waiting on input` | ⏸ Apr 15 – Apr 28 — see Waiting on Input below |
| acme/site#444 | Dark mode for the account pages | `Backlog` | 🚫 Closed, not planned — nobody has asked for it; reopen if that changes |

### Stale Issues

**58 stale business issues** across `Backlog` and `Ready for *`, untouched 8+ weeks; **7 newly
stale** since this cycle opened. 54 of the 58 are `Backlog`.

> Triage at this scale will not be fixed one issue at a time — acme/site#390 is the lever worth
> pulling, and it is committed to this cycle and the next few.

**Close candidates**

| Issue | Title | Why it's a candidate | Decision |
| ----- | ----- | -------------------- | -------- |
| acme/site#102 | Investigate an idea for the landing page | Open 14 months. The issue template was never filled in — every section is still an empty comment. | ✅ Closed, not planned |
| acme/api#61 | Consider caching the catalogue response | Open 9 months, empty body, no comments. The title is the entire specification. | ✅ Closed, not planned |
| acme/api#77 | Cache catalogue responses at the edge | Duplicates acme/api#61, filed later with more detail. | ✅ Closed as duplicate of acme/api#61 |

**Needs a cycle, not a close**

| Issue | Title | Why | Decision |
| ----- | ----- | --- | -------- |
| acme/site#390 | Review and close the never-triaged backlog | `Ready for Human`. Genuinely needed — it is the only item that addresses the 58 above — but has sat untriaged for six weeks. | ➡️ This cycle, and the next few |

**Newly stale, worth a look**

| Issue | Title | Why it's worth a look | Decision |
| ----- | ----- | --------------------- | -------- |
| acme/infra#84 | Remove the old vendor's IAM roles | Went stale during the very cycle themed on the vendor migration. | ✅ Closed — the work was done and the issue was left open by accident |
| acme/api#198 | Epic: schema consolidation | Real design discussion in the comments, and it looked close to agreement before it went quiet. | ➡️ Reporting refresh |

### Waiting on Input

| Issue | Question | Decision |
| ----- | -------- | -------- |
| acme/infra#96 | Is moving search to a managed service worth the cost, or do we keep running it ourselves? | Worth doing eventually, but not now — revisit once search relevance work has settled and we know the real query load. Deferred to Apr 15 – Apr 28. |
| acme/site#433 | Which customer segments should see the new pricing display? | Not resolved — nobody on the call had the definitive answer. Left as `Waiting on input`; it will reappear in next cycle's notes on its own. |

### Significant Dates

_Upcoming events to plan releases around._

| Date | Event | Note |
| ---- | ----- | ---- |
| Thu 26 Mar | Quarterly catalogue refresh | Highest-traffic day of the quarter. No deploys that day; the release goes out the following morning. |
| Mon 6 Apr | Finance close for Q1 | Refund and rounding behaviour must not change during that week. |

### Committed This Cycle

| Issue | Title | Status |
| ----- | ----- | ------ |
| acme/site#421 | Migrate stored payment methods to the new vendor | `In progress` |
| acme/api#219 | Split the checkout handler so failures are isolated | `In progress` |
| acme/site#390 | Review and close the never-triaged backlog | `Ready for Human` |
| acme/api#215 | Retire the vendor webhook shim | `Ready for Human` |
| acme/api#224 | Document the search ranking fields | `Ready for Agent` |
| acme/site#437 | Search returns nothing for hyphenated terms | `Backlog` |

## Future Work

_The two cycles after the current one. Committing work here now means it has a home when the current
cycle closes, rather than being re-argued every fortnight._

### Reporting refresh (1 Apr → 14 Apr 2026)

| Issue | Title | Status |
| ----- | ----- | ------ |
| acme/api#198 | Epic: schema consolidation | `Backlog` |
| acme/site#441 | Add a "recently viewed" row to the listings page | `Backlog` |

The listings redesign is already designed and underway in a pull request. It sits beneath
acme/site#441, along with acme/site#446 — "Sort recently viewed by last visit" — which was folded in
as part of that work.

### Apr 15 – Apr 28 2026

_No theme agreed yet, so the cycle carries its dates as a placeholder until one is._

| Issue | Title | Status |
| ----- | ----- | ------ |
| acme/infra#96 | Evaluate a managed search service | `Waiting on input` |

## Out of Office

- **ALEX:** Out 24–26 Mar.
- No other absences reported for the current or upcoming cycles.

## Next Actions

_Each follow-up as **OWNER:** action, stated as the outcome rather than the mechanics. Tracker
writes default to the project manager, delegated to the agent as needed; name the person when it is
someone else's job._

- **SAM:** Email the team proposing that Apr 15 – Apr 28 be spent clearing work that was already in
  progress before cycles were introduced.
- **SAM:** Create an issue for the 26 Mar catalogue refresh — nothing on the board covers it.
- **ALEX:** Get a definitive answer on the pricing-display segments in acme/site#433 before the next
  meeting, and record it on the issue.
````

## Known limitations

- **Rescheduling has no convention.** Correcting a cycle date that has already been agreed and
  published is a different problem from setting the next cycle's date for the first time, which
  branch B does directly. The mechanism is the configuration write above; what is missing is who
  decides and how it is recorded. Work one out and document it here the next time a cycle actually
  needs moving.

## Iterating on the skill

This skill is committed, so it versions and reviews like code. Three habits keep it improving
rather than calcifying:

- **Fix the skill, not the output.** Whenever a draft needs hand-editing, that edit is a bug
  report. Change the skill and re-run rather than patching the notes by hand.
- **File skill bugs as issues** (`enhancement`) so they flow through the same triage and cycle
  machinery as everything else — the workflow tests itself.
- **Edit it with `/writing-for-agents`.** Its no-op test (delete whole sentences that don't
  change behaviour) is the antidote to a skill that accretes caveats after every awkward run.
